The Free Store is built using Mozilla's A-Frame javascript framework, assets created by the artist liooil, and assets found online on sites like thingiverse, sketchfab, turbosquid, etc.. 

Everything in the free store links to a project free to download, as expected- please let me know if there are any issues.
